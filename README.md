# MachineLearningPotential
MachineLearningPotential is a repository containing the training datasets and trained Machine-Learning Potentials for the equiatomic CrCoNi published with our work ``Quantifying chemical short-range order in metallic alloys``

The atom type mapping for the potential and training dataset are: {0: 'Cr', 1: 'Co', 2: 'Ni'}
